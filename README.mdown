Solution for [All Wired Up, a puzzle from PuzzleNode][awu].

Recursive methods; functions that return values; immutable data structures;
data-centric programming; lists and trees. Simple things that work.

Thank God I discovered Lisp, SICP, Clojure, and Rich Hickey. This solution would have
been a lot worse without your influence. Here's a little haiku about what I mean:

_now, there's no urge to define a class  
each time I need to pass a gas._
